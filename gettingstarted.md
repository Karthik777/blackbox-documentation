## Key Features
## How to set up your blackbox
_In this step you will install the Heroku Command Line Interface (CLI), formerly known as the Heroku Toolbelt. You will use the CLI to manage and scale your applications, to provision add-ons, to view the logs of your application as it runs on Heroku, as well as to help run your application locally._
## How to register and authenticate your account
_Authenticate your account when using the API by including your secret API key in the request. You can manage your API keys in the Dashboard. Your API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secret! Do not share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.
## How to use
_To use the sdk, you will need to add the libraries to your project. To get the libraries, you can either download the released ones, or build your own with the sources (see how to build the SDK).
