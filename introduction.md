## Welcome to the Blackbox Documentation

The Blackbox system makes it easy to deploy and scale Autonomous systems in unpredictable physical environments. Whether you prefer programming in Python or Javascript, or getting your hands dirty with C++ and raw sockets, Blackbox keeps the complexity of cutting-edge CV out of your way — allowing you to build complex systems faster, and leaving you to focus on solving real world problems.

These docs cover how to set up, configure, and optimise autonomous applications with the blackbox sensor system. The documentation is broken up into the following sections:

1. _Introduction_
2. Getting Started
3. Making Websocket Requests
4. Demo Applications:
    1. Robotic control in Python
    2. Building a simple dashboard with Javascript
3. Blackbox Architecture
4. Deployment 
5. Monitoring and Metrics
6. Security
7. Terms & Licence

```
